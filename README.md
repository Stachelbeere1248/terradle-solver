# terradle-solver
An algorithm to solve [https://www.terradle.com/](terradle.com).

The algorith determines the guess with the lowest average (arithmetic mean) amount of possible weapons for the next guess, based on the new information it will provide.
Currently it only ranks openers, I will soon implement an interactive way to input the information provided by the guess, to repeatedly determine the next best guess, until the correct item (or an item list with equal stats to it) has been found.
